Explanation
Django Setup: Install Django, create a project, and add an app for data analysis.
File Upload Feature: Create a form to upload CSV files, handle file uploads, and save files to the media directory.
Data Processing: Use pandas to read the CSV file and perform data analysis (summary statistics, handling missing values).
Data Visualization: Generate histograms for numerical columns using matplotlib and seaborn, encode images in base64 format to display in templates.
User Interface: Use Django templates to create forms for file upload and pages to display analysis results and visualizations.
This structure provides a clear workflow for users to upload CSV files, perform data analysis, and visualize the results on a web interface.
