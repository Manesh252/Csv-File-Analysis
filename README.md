### 1. Django Setup:
- *Initialize a Django Project*: Use the django-admin startproject command to create a new Django project.
- *Create a Django App*: Inside the project directory, use python manage.py startapp to create a new app.
- *Configure Settings*: In the settings.py file, add your app to the INSTALLED_APPS list and set up the database configuration.

### 2. File Upload Feature:
- *Create a Model*: Define a model in models.py to handle the uploaded files.
- *Form for File Upload*: In forms.py, create a ModelForm for the file upload that links to your model.
- *View to Handle Uploads*: Write a view in views.py that handles the file upload form submission.
- *URL Configuration*: Update urls.py to include the URL for the file upload view.

### 3. Data Processing:
- *Read CSV File*: Use pandas.read_csv() to read the uploaded file into a DataFrame.
- *Display Data*: Use DataFrame.head() to show the first few rows.
- *Summary Statistics*: Calculate statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation using methods like DataFrame.mean(), DataFrame.median(), and DataFrame.std().
- *Handle Missing Values*: Use DataFrame.fillna() or DataFrame.dropna() to handle missing data.

### 4. Data Visualization:
- *Plotting*: Use matplotlib or seaborn to create histograms with DataFrame.plot.hist() or seaborn.histplot().
- *Integrate with Django*: Save the plots as images and serve them in the Django templates.

### 5. User Interface:
- *Create Templates*: Use Django's templating language to create HTML files for your interface.
- *Display Results*: Pass the data analysis results and plot images to the templates using the context in your views.
- *Organize Content*: Use Bootstrap or similar frameworks to style the content and make it user-friendly.
